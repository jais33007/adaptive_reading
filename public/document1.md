Bienvenue! Welcome to the intermediate French grammar course focusing on verb conjugation. Verbs are the backbone of any language, and mastering their conjugation is essential for fluency. In this module, we will delve into the intricacies of conjugating verbs in different tenses and moods.

Let's begin with the present tense, which describes actions happening now or habitual actions. In French, regular verbs follow patterns based on their infinitive endings (-er, -ir, -re), while irregular verbs have unique conjugations. For example, the verb "parler" (to speak) conjugates as je parle, tu parles, il/elle parle, nous parlons, vous parlez, ils/elles parlent.

Moving on to the past tense, we have several forms such as the passé composé, imparfait, and passé simple. The passé composé is formed using an auxiliary verb (avoir or être) and the past participle of the main verb. For instance, "j'ai mangé" means "I ate" or "I have eaten." Meanwhile, the imparfait is used to describe ongoing or repeated past actions, and the passé simple is primarily found in written French, particularly literature.

Additionally, we'll explore the subjunctive mood, which expresses uncertainty, doubt, desire, or necessity. Conjugating verbs in the subjunctive can be challenging as it often deviates from the regular patterns. However, mastering the subjunctive is crucial for expressing nuanced ideas and emotions in French. Throughout this course, we will practice conjugating verbs in various tenses and moods to enhance your proficiency in French grammar.
